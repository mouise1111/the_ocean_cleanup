## Overview
Our project, "Ocean3D," aims to raise awareness and support for The Ocean Cleanup's mission. Ocean3D will revolutionize the online presence of The Ocean Cleanup by transforming their existing 2D website into an immersive 3D experience. By incorporating interactive storytelling, we not only address the urgent issue of ocean plastic pollution but also provide a unique and engaging platform for users to explore, learn, and contribute to the cause.
